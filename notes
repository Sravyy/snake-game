a. define a constructor for the snake(head piece first)
  1. set velocity vectors to 0, direction to right by giving vx = 1;

  2. create a blank array for children

  3. create a snake variable and add div class snake to use it append it to container as we add child pieces.

  4. set the PIXEL_SIZE to the size of the snake, BOARD_WIDTH(ex :container size(300)/PIXEL_SIZE(5)).

  5. create an update function where we set, vectors defined equal to the velocity defined. this is to find new position
